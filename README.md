# hello-world

Hello!

Jean-Simon here. I know a little bit of programming (Python, programming web in development(HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript))
I learn new programming languages for the future (One day at a time...with a coffee of course!!)
My goal is create a website for myself and share my experiences of iOS apps.
I love tacos, vegan food and fish (Yes, I eat anything...).

Thank you for reading me!
